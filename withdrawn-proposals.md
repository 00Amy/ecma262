| [Error.isError](https://github.com/ljharb/proposal-is-error) | Jordan Harband | Withdrawn in favor of a proposal to standardize Error stack traces |
| [Set/Map.prototype.toJSON](https://github.com/DavidBruant/Map-Set.prototype.toJSON) | David Bruant and Jordan Harband | Better solved by a custom replacer function.
